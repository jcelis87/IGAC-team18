# Team 18 - DS4A project

The base code for our project is hosted in 3 GitHub repositories. They are divided as follows:

## Model and data sources

url: [https://github.com/jcelis87/IGAC-team18.git](https://github.com/jcelis87/IGAC-team18.git)

Here we have all of our preliminary data analysis, including the extraction of toponyms for Chaparral, Tolima, using Google Maps and Open Street Maps. 

We also have in this repository all the versions of the code that we used to build the model.

## Back-end App

url: [https://github.com/jcelis87/team18-back-end-app.git](https://github.com/jcelis87/team18-back-end-app.git)

In this repository we created an API using the FastAPI library with multiple endpoints that aim to supply the required data for the Front-end.

The model is also hosted here as `model1.py`

## Front-end App

url: [https://github.com/jcelis87/team18-front-end-app.git](https://github.com/jcelis87/team18-front-end-app.git)

In this repository we have our Dash App that consumes the API from the back-end.
